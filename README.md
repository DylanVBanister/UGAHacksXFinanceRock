## Purpose
We wanted to complete Truist's challenge to create a gamified app meant to teach anyone about finance concepts. UGAHack's theme this year was Rock n' Roll, so we thought it would be interesting to combine the two. The user is able to interact with non playable characters in the world, who ask the user questions about finance concepts. The user has to answer the questions correctly to earn tickets, which is the form of progression for our game.

## Tools Utilized
We used the ThreeJS 3D Javascript library to build this application.

## Problems We Ran Into
Working with a new library, we faced challenges with understanding the different features available to us. It wasn't always intuitive, but we managed to find our way over these hurdles.
